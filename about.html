        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Objective: I am a graphic designer raised in the San Francisco Bay Area and trained in the graphic design program at California State University East Bay. Though I may not be a storyteller myself, one thing I strive to do is capture the feelings
            of stories being told whether that be a story coming from real life interaction, such as a taekwondo instructor and his students, or from music, books, movies, and video games. As a fan of all of these forms of storytelling I often find inspiration
            in their creativity and depth which makes me strive to always want to be better. It is my ultimate goal to one day help a movie or video game studio bring their creation to life. Awards: In High School I won an anti smoking poster contest
            put on by the School Wellness and Safety Program by the Alameda County Office of Education because of my use of imagery and text in order to convey the message. This first success helped spark my creative journey in order to learn more about
            art digitally and physically so that I could begin to grow and learn to create work that is entirely my own. Iâ€™ve also earned the highest rank in the Boy Scouts of America; Eagle Scout. The BSA creates life events for people at a young age
            to help them grow and develop to become active members of society. As well as provides rigorous leadership training that helps me in all leadership opportunities I have today.</p>
