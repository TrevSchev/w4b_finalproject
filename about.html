        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          Objective: I am a graphic designer raised in the San Francisco Bay
          Area and trained in the graphic design program at California State
          University East Bay. Though I may not be a storyteller myself, one
          thing I strive to do is capture the feelings of stories being told
          whether that be a story coming from real life interaction, such as a
          taekwondo instructor and his students, or from music, books, movies,
          and video games. As a fan of all of these forms of storytelling I
          often find inspiration in their creativity and depth which makes me
          strive to always want to be better. It is my ultimate goal to one day
          help a movie or video game studio bring their creation to life.

          Awards: In High School I won an anti smoking poster contest put on by
          the School Wellness and Safety Program by the Alameda County Office of
          Education because of my use of imagery and text in order to convey the
          message. This first success helped spark my creative journey in order
          to learn more about art digitally and physically so that I could begin
          to grow and learn to create work that is entirely my own. Iâ€™ve also
          earned the highest rank in the Boy Scouts of America; Eagle Scout. The
          BSA creates life events for people at a young age to help them grow
          and develop to become active members of society. As well as provides
          rigorous leadership training that helps me in all leadership
          opportunities I have today.
