          Logo | Scalable | 02/2019 | Client: Musick Elementary and Preschool |
          Program: Illustrator
        </h3>
        <p>
          This is one of my most popular designs. Based on a teacher
          recommendation the principal of Musick Elementary school in Newark
          California sought my skills when the school was in need of a new logo.
          I was given a lot of freedom to design this project and therefore made
          sure to think through every aspect of the design. First, I chose to
          incorporate the school’s mascot, the leopard, and the school’s colors
          (black and gold). To match the school’s aesthetic I chose to use a
          sans serif font for the logo. Additionally I used a large thick “M” to
          support the strong profile of the leopard. Although the san serif font
          worked well for other elements of the logo, the “M” itself needed
          something unique. Ultimately I chose to create the “M” from scratch in
          Illustrator to create the shape that would work best. The final
          product was delivered to the school in color, black and white, as well
          as a monogram version of the “M” itself. It is now being prominently
          used in the school’s merchandise, materials, and website.
